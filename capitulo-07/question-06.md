# Questão 06 - Capítulo 07

## Question

**6.  Using conditional assembly, modify the MULACC macro defined in this chapter
to not only eliminate the redundant looping but also not generate the loop
instruction itself in the case that the multiplier in the operand is 0 and the answer
is 0, or when it is 1 and the answer is just the value in the accumulator. (Hint:
Use the power macro as an example.)**
